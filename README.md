- I'm making new examples for Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) in JavaScript which are easy to follow.
- I started working with Andy Pai's implementation of micrograd: [neuroflow.js](https://github.com/abpai/neuroflow-js)
- It was easy to get started with as a viable frame of reference for working with micrograd in Javascript.
- I made some changes and enhancements to focus on usability and I'm hacking out some new examples here.
